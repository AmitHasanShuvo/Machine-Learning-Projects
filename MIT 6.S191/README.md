# MIT Introduction to Deep Learning | 6.S191
This video came up randomly on my YouTube recommendations and out of curiosity, I started watching this. I was so amazed at the quality of the content that, I took my notebook and sit in front of that video for 3 hours.

This is an MIT's introductory course on deep learning methods (open-course), the revised version of 2020, instructed by Sir Alexander Amini and Ava Soleimany. 
Alexander Amini started the lecture with the “Foundations of Deep Learning” topic and pointed out each & every fundamental so perfectly.

I did complete the first introductory video on deep learning as of now.
Anyone can grab almost everything he explained in the video.
The whole video (52 minutes) divided into some parts like The perceptron, Activation functions, Perceptron example, From perceptrons to neural networks, Applying neural networks, Loss functions, Training and gradient descent, Backpropagation, Setting the learning rate, Batched gradient descent, Regularization: dropout and early stopping.

I did take some notes while watching the lecture. I am attaching my handwritten notes with this article.

I can bet you that, this is the best lecture on Deep Learning you will find on the Internet. Every deep learning enthusiastic should take this course. Thank you, MIT and Alexander Amini for this wonderful course.
