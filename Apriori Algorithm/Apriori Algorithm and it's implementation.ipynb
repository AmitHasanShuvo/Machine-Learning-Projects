It’s a data mining technique that is used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules.\n\nExample: Recommending products based on your purchased items. You can see this in different e-commerce websites. (Recommendation system)\n\n\n**Things that we need to know before implementation:**\n\n**Association rule:** \nIt identifies frequent patterns and associations(relations) among a set of items. Ex: If you go to buy a keyboard, you might also get a mouse. So place them aside in your market to get more profit.\n\n**Support:** \nSupport refers to the default popularity of an item and can be calculated by finding the number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions.\n```\nSupport (Keyboard) = (Transactions containing (Keyboard)) / (Total Transactions))\n\n```\n**Confidence:**\nConfidence refers to the likelihood that an item B (mouse) is also bought if item A (keyboard) is bought. Like our keyboard and mouse example. \n\n`Confidence(Keyboard→Mouse) = (Transactions containing both (Keyboard and Mouse))/(Transactions containing Keyboard)`\n\n**Lift:**\nLift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) refers to the increase in the ratio of sale of Mouse when the Keyboard is sold. \nLift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(Keyboard→Mouse) divided by Support(Mouse). \n\n```\nLift(Keyboard -&gt; Mouse) = (Confidence(Keyboard→Mouse))   /  (Support (Mouse))\n\n```\n\n\n\nReferences: \n1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/apriori-algorithm/\n2. https://stackabuse.com/association-rule-mining-via-apriori-algorithm-in-python/\n3. https://github.com/AmitHasanShuvo/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/Apriori%20Algorithm\n4. https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/157119","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Code ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nfrom mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/supermarket/GroceryStoreDataSet.csv',names=['Products'],header=None)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = list(data[\"Products\"].apply(lambda x:x.split(',')))\ndata ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder\nte = TransactionEncoder()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"te_data = te.fit(data).transform(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.DataFrame(te_data,columns=te.columns_)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"frq_items = apriori(df, min_support = 0.1, use_colnames = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"frq_items","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rules = association_rules(frq_items, metric =\"lift\", min_threshold = 1) \nrules = rules.sort_values(['confidence', 'lift'], ascending =[False, False])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(rules.head())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
